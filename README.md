# 🏥 Insurance Data Analysis 📊

Welcome to the **Insurance Data Analysis Project**! 🚀  
This project explores a health insurance dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn** to uncover insights into medical costs and demographics.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset (`insurance.csv`) contains **1338 records** with the following columns:

- 👶 **Age** – Age of the insured  
- 👩‍🦱 **Sex** – Gender (`male` / `female`)  
- ⚖️ **BMI** – Body Mass Index  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Children** – Number of dependents  
- 🚬 **Smoker** – Smoking status (`yes` / `no`)  
- 🌍 **Region** – Residential area (`northeast`, `northwest`, `southeast`, `southwest`)  
- 💰 **Charges** – Medical costs billed by health insurance

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps performed in the analysis:

1. ✅ Checked for **missing values**  
2. 📊 Explored **data distribution** (Age, BMI, Charges, etc.)  
3. 👫 Counted **gender distribution**  
4. 🧪 Compared **smoker vs. non-smoker charges**  
5. 📦 Used **boxplots & histograms** for visualization

## 📈 Visualizations
Some of the plots generated include:

- 📊 **Distribution of Age**
- 👫 **Gender counts**
- 🚬 **Charges by Smoking Status**
- 🌍 **Region-wise distributions**
- ⚖️ **BMI vs Charges**
